# A Random Game Website
## Made by ElectroCubic (Anush Bundel)

## Check out the Live Demo [here](https://electrocubic.github.io/RandomGameWebsite/)!

### Tech Stack used: HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

## Cube Controls:
- Use the Arrow keys or A/D to move left and right, use the Up Arrow key / Space to jump.
- Use mouse for interacting with buttons and sliders.

## Brief Explanantion about the idea for the website:
I had the idea of giving the user total control of a Cube character, which is the only way they can use to proceed to other webpages, and crafting tricky and annoying UI layouts to trick the user into faliing the challenges they have to complete to create a simple account! It's similar to a platforming rage game, in a unique twist with UI interactions and controls implemented via fun mechanics, such as manual elevators, moving platforms, lava, random number selection etc. to create difficult (but definitely possible) levels to induce 'mild' frustration in various scenarios.
You can just reload the page if your cube gets stuck or gets out of screen or something... you'll only lose the current level's progression only.

I hope you have "Fun" cube platforming experience from visiting my website! :)
