# RandomGameWebsite
## Made by ElectroCubic (Anush Bundel)

### Tech Stack used: HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

## Cube Controls:
- Use the Arrow keys or A/D to move left and right, use the Up Arrow key / Space to jump.
- Use mouse for interacting with buttons and sliders.

## Brief Explanantion about the idea for the website:
I had the idea of giving the user total control of a Cube character, which is the the only way they can use proceed to other webpages, and crafting tricky and annoying UI layouts to trick the user into faliing the challenges they have to complete to create a simple account! It's similar to a platforming rage game, in a unique twist with UI interactions and controls implemented via fun mechanics, such as manual elevators, moving platforms, lava, number selection etc. to create difficult scenarios to induce 'mild' frustration.

I hope you have "Fun" cube platforming experience from visiting my website! :)
